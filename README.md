# AlcoveShopBot
Generates out-of-stock alerts and financial reports from QuickShop buy/sell comments in Minecraft chat logs. Made for The Alcove player-run store on the ChillSMP Minecraft server. Not affiliated with any of those.

### Install steps:

- Copy to permanent location. Wherever you run it from, it has to stay there, or you'll have to put the webhook in again.
- Double-click. 
- Windows will pop up a big blue box. Click the "More Info" link near the top.

- App will open. Click the `Edit` menu, then `Edit Webhook`. Copy the URL that I will give you, and paste it in here. (Be careful with it, or someone could send David Hasselhoff mem to your shop channel!)
- Click "Run" and the bot should announce all old out of stocks in your log. 

It might freeze sometimes, if your Minecraft log gets really big (more than 1 million lines), so wait bit. If it freezes for a really long time, click "Stop" a few times and wait for a while, to see if it stops and was just reading a long file. If it never stops, open an [Issue](https://github.com/Gilgamech/AlcoveShopBot/issues).
